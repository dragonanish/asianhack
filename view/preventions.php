                <h3>How to deal with Harrassment</h3>

                Here are seven ideas for strategies you can consider and choose from when you are faced with harassment.<br><br>

                1. Respond: If you feel safe enough to do so, assertively respond to the harassers calmly, firmly, and without
                insults or personal attacks to let them know that their actions are unwelcome, unacceptable, and wrong.<br><br>

                2. Step In: Intervene when someone else is being harassed to help them out of the situation and let the
                harasser know that their actions are not condoned by others. Ask them if they want help and what they’d like you
                to do or simply check-in to see if they’re okay. Men engaging in this tactic can be particularly powerful since men
                (the majority of street harassers) look to other men for approval.<br><br>

                3. Report to Employer: If the harassers work for an identifiable company, call or write the company to let them
                know that their employees are harassing people on the job and why that is unacceptable.<br><br>

                4. Report to Police or Transit Workers: Take actions that will create real consequences for the harasser, s
                uch as reporting the person to a police officer or other person of authority, like a bus driver or subway employee.<br><br>

                6. Take Creative Action: Respond to harassers in a surprising, creative way.<br><br>

                <h3>Dealing with Rape</h3>

                1.Get to a safe place.<br>
                The first thing you should do if you are in any immediate danger is to get yourself to a safe place.<br><br>
                2. Tell somewhat has happened.<br>
                Once you are out of danger, tell the first person you see what has happened or contact someone you know
                and trust and tell them the whole story while it is fresh in your mind. Although this can be difficult,
                it is very important because this person can help with the police investigation and later support your story in court.
                They are known as the first contact witness.<br><br>
                3. Preserve evidence of the rape.<br>
                The one thing you may want to do is wash. If you do, you run the risk of washing away all physical evidence of the
                rape so do not bathe, shower or wash your clothes. Doing this would get rid of blood, semen, saliva or hair that could
                be used as evidence of the rape. If you are injured, go straight to your nearest hospital, community health center or doctor.<br><br>
                4. Decide whether you want to report the rape.<br>
                You do not have to decide immediately whether to report the rape to the police but the sooner a doctor
                \examines you, the more likely they are to find physical evidence that they can link to the rapist.
                If you decide to report the rape to the police, then you should go to your nearest police station where
                the officers must take your statement. The police will take you to a health center where you will receive
                medical attention and undergo a forensic examination. If you do not report the rape, you can go directly to
                a health center to get these services.<br><br>
                3. Get medicine to prevent unwanted pregnancies, HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).<br>
                After the forensic examination, the doctor will give you the morning-after pill to prevent
                pregnancy and antibiotics to prevent possible STIs) You will also be given an HIV test and if it is negative
                you will be given antiretroviral treatment for 28 days to prevent contracting HIV. This is called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).<br><br>
                4. Get support to help you to recover.<br>
                You can get the support you need further down the line by asking for pamphlets or booklets on rape,
                and the number of a local counseling service that can give you support and advice on the police report, an eventual
                court case, and you are own physical and emotional wellbeing. If you do fall pregnant or contract an STI it is important
                to seek to follow up medical care and counseling.<br><br>
